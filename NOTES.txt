2)    Difference between library and framework ?

i) Library - Library is a collection of pre-written code that can be used to perform common    tasks or add specific functionality to a program . Libraries are oftern written in a specific programming lanfulage and are designed to be easily reusable and modular.Library collection code are tested and dubugged code that can be reused and make it time save time and make faster projects . 

For example :- jQuery , ReactJS

ii) Framework - A framework is like a foundation for developers to build applications for a particular platform. It contains reusable code written to perform common tasks, with code provided by the custom fucntion developer. Frameworks can contain defined and undefined objects and functions that developers can use to build their applications. 

For example :- Django , Ruby on Rails , Laravel

while the react-dom package deals with rendering React Components in the browser. It contains the API's required for interacting with the browser's DOM and efficiently updating only the parts that need update. most commonly used function's in this package are ReactDOM.render().

7)  what is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN ?

Development is the stage of an application before it's made public while production is the term used for the same application when it's made public. Development build is several times (maybe 3-5x) slower than the production build.

8) what is async and defer ?

async - The async attribute is a boolean attribute. The script is downloaded in parallel(in the background) to parsing the page, and executed as soon as it is available (do not block HTML DOM construction during downloading process) and donâ€™t wait for anything.

Syntax :- <script src="demo_async.js" async></script>

defer - The defer attribute is a boolean attribute. The script is downloaded in parallel(in the background) to parsing the page, and executed after the page has finished parsing(when browser finished DOM construction). The defer attribute tells the browser not to wait for the script. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, build DOM.

Syntax - <script src="demo_defer.js" defer></script>
